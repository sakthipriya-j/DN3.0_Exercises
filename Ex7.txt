Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting

Step 1: Understand Recursive Algorithms

Recursion

1.Recursion simplifies problems by breaking them into smaller, identical problems. It involves functions calling themselves with modified parameters until a base case is reached.

Step 2: Setup

1.Create a method to calculate future value using recursion.

Step 3: Implementation

public class FinancialForecasting {
    public double forecastValue(double currentValue, double growthRate, int years) {
        if (years == 0) {
            return currentValue;
        }
        return forecastValue(currentValue * (1 + growthRate), growthRate, years - 1);
    }
}

Step 4: Analysis

1.Time Complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity, where n is the number of years.
2.Optimization: Use memoization or iterative approach to avoid excessive recursive calls and stack overflow for large input sizes.
