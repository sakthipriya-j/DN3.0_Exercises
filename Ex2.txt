Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

Step 1: Understand Asymptotic Notation

Big O Notation

1.Big O notation: A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, used in computer science to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
2.Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:
    Linear Search: O(n) in all cases.
    Binary Search: Best - O(1), Average/Worst - O(log n) but requires a sorted array.

Step 2: Setup

1.Create a class for Product with necessary attributes.

Step 3: Implementation

class Product {
    int productId;
    String productName;
    String category;

    public Product(int productId, String productName, String category) {
        this.productId = productId;
        this.productName = productName;
        this.category = category;
    }
}

class Search {
    public Product linearSearch(Product[] products, String productName) {
        for (Product product : products) {
            if (product.productName.equals(productName)) {
                return product;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public Product binarySearch(Product[] products, String productName) {
        int left = 0, right = products.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int result = products[mid].productName.compareTo(productName);
            if (result == 0) {
                return products[mid];
            }
            if (result < 0) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}

Step 4: Analysis

1.Linear Search: O(n) - Iterates through each element until the desired element is found or the end is reached.
2.Binary Search: O(log n) - More efficient for sorted arrays, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Suitability

1.Binary search is more suitable for large, sorted datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
